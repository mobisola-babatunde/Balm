# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Case Study: “Balm” a wellness and self-care app


## **Introduction**

### **Background**

In this PRD, I will outline the specifications and requirements for the development of a wellness and self-care app called Balm. This project has been developed as part of the EntryLevel Product Management Level 2 course. This individual project required the selection of a single product from four hypothetical project briefs. I chose this project to diversify my product management portfolio.

### **Product Overview**

The app will provide users with a comprehensive and personalized tool that makes it easy for them to improve their mental health and overall well-being. The intention is to empower users to take control of their well-being and improve their quality of life by providing them with the information and tools they need to make better decisions.

This PRD will provide a detailed outline of the product requirements, including user stories, and features. It will also include a product roadmap for the development process, as well as a pre-launch communication plan and launch strategies.

### Your Role:

As the Product Manager and Product Designer, my responsibilities included developing the Product Requirements Document (PRD), designing the user interface and user experience (UI/UX), and overseeing the conceptualization and planning phases of the HolistiqCare app. This document showcases my work in creating the PRD and design specifications for the app.

### Design Process:

Iterative design approach with feedback loops from potential users to refine UI/UX, which included Wireframing, Prototyping, and UI/UX Design.

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Strategy:

A comprehensive testing strategy was developed to ensure the app’s functionality and user experience. This included: 

- **Usability Testing:** Conducted with a small group of users to identify and fix usability issues.

### Results:

- Initial feedback highlighted areas for improvement in the wellness assessment feature, these issues were addressed promptly.

## Product Launch Strategy and Implementation

**Launch Strategy 1:** Alpha / Beta / General Availability Release

In this approach, we will initially launch the product in an alpha version to a limited set of customers. This will enable us to gather feedback and improve the product before we release it to a broader audience. The alpha release will be by invitation only, and we will identify and reach out to a select group of potential customers who are most likely to be interested in our product.

Once we have gathered enough feedback and made the necessary improvements, we will release the product in a beta version. The beta release will be publicly announced, and we will invite a larger group of customers to test and use the product. This will give us valuable insights into how customers use the product and what additional features or improvements they may want.

Finally, once we have incorporated all the necessary feedback and made the product ready for general availability, we will launch it to the general public. We will have a well-thought-out marketing plan in place to ensure that our target audience is aware of the product launch and can easily purchase it.

This launch strategy is a good fit for our Balm product as it will allow us to test the product with a select group of customers and gather feedback before making it available to the general public. It will help us refine the product and improve its features, which will ultimately result in a more successful product launch.
